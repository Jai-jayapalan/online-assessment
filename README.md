Here's the improved README file with clear step-by-step instructions:

# Online Assessment – Coding Test

This repository contains my solutions for the coding test.  
The test can be taken in any programming language, and I have chosen **Python 3**.  

---

## 📌 Language Used
- **Python 3**

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `Program-1.py` → Calculator (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division using class)
- `Program-2.py` → Generates a series of numbers based on input pattern
- `Program-3.py` → Generates odd number sequence based on input pattern
- `Program-4.py` → Counts numbers divisible by 1-9 in a given list

---

## 📝 Notes
- All programs are implemented in **Python 3**.  
- Each file contains **inline comments** explaining the logic.  
- Problems are solved in separate files for clarity.  
- Input/output format is kept simple and user-friendly.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jai-jayapalan/online-assessment.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
```bash
cd online-assessment
```

### Step 3: Run Any Program
Execute any program using Python:

**Program 1 - Calculator:**
```bash
python Program-1.py
```

**Program 2 - Number Series Generator:**
```bash
python Program-2.py
```

**Program 3 - Odd Number Sequence:**
```bash
python Program-3.py
```

**Program 4 - Multiples Counter:**
```bash
python Program-4.py
```

### Step 4: Follow On-Screen Instructions
Each program will prompt you for input and display the output accordingly.

---

## 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Basic understanding of command line operations

---

## 🎯 Example Usage
For Program 1 (Calculator):
```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Enter operation (add, sub, mul, div): add
Result: 15.0
```

Each program is self-contained and will guide you through the input process.
